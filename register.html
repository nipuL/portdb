<h2>Register your ports repository</h2>
<p>You can register your personal HttpUp repository sending an email with the following information to <i>contrib-admin at crux dot nu</i>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Repository Name <small>(e.g. myports)</small></li>
  <li>Root URL <small>(e.g. http://mypage.se/ports/)</small></li>
  <li>Your name</li>
  <li>Your Email</li>
</ul>
<p>A CRUX team member will put your repository into our database. Please give us some time to do this. Once it is active it is synced once a day. <b>Please do not submit .httpup files, only the URL for the repository. This means the URL to the repository itself, not portspage or other indexes.</b></p>
